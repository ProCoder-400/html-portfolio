<h2>My top 3 books of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Jannat Kay Pattay</h3>
<p>An amazing novel that explores the life of Haya and Jihan as they encounter numerous problems and challenges in their
    life. And here is a beautiful quote from the book: <br />
    <br />"Shroo mein Islam ajnabi tha<br />
    Aur anqareeb phir ajnabi ho jae ga<br />
    Salam ho un ajnabiyon par"<br />
</p>

<h3>Peer e Kamil</h3>
<p>A must to read novel that revolves around Imama and Salaar as they find the right path.</p>

<h3>Aab e Hiyaat</h3>
<p>This is the second part of Peer e Kamil that dives deeper into the life of Imama and Salaar as they embark on their
    journey for life.</p>
