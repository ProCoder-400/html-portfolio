<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is [Your Name], and I am passionate about coding. In my journey so far, I have
  created two basic HTML projects. The first showcases my three favorite books of all time, reflecting my love for
  reading and web design. The second is a birthday invitation website, combining creativity with functionality. These
  projects highlight my foundational skills in HTML and my enthusiasm for bringing ideas to life through code. As I
  continue to develop my skills, I am excited to take on new challenges and create more innovative web solutions.</p>

<p>Through these initial projects, I have gained a solid understanding of HTML, which serves as the backbone of web
  development. By showcasing my favorite books, I was able to delve into the intricacies of web design, focusing on
  layout, structure, and aesthetics. The birthday invitation website project allowed me to explore interactivity and
  user engagement, creating a site that is both functional and visually appealing. Each project has taught me valuable
  lessons in attention to detail and the importance of user experience</p>

<p>As I continue my journey in coding, I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills into other areas such as CSS,
  JavaScript, and beyond. My goal is to create dynamic and responsive websites that not only meet the needs of users but
  also provide a seamless and enjoyable experience. My future project included making a website for IGCSE past papers, a
  to-do list website, and a few apps for my own personal work. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward
  to sharing more of my work as I grow in this exciting field.</p>
